              <h1>Body Parts-Reduces all damage received by 50%</h1>
              
              <h1>Arm Parts-X can charge up to a third level that fires a more powerful Charge Shot. He also gains the ability to perform Charge Shots of the Special Weapons obtained from defeated Mavericks.</h1>
              <h1>Foot Parts- Enables the dash function on the ground. This dash ability was designed to be internalized inside X's own system in the games after this, allowing him to have the same dash function without the use of armor. This enhancement also allows X to destroy certain blocks by kicking off of them.</h1>

              <h1>Head Parts-The Item Tracer is made available. X sends out a cursor, which zooms to concealed passages and items. Interestingly, although the Item Tracer has an unlimited number of uses, it displays an ammo gauge while equipped.

              </h1>
              
              
              <h1>Body Parts-Enables the "Giga Crush" technique;as X takes damage from projectiles, a gauge fills. When this gauge is completely full, X can use the aforementioned attack, which damages all enemies on screen. All energy is used after the attack, and unlike X's normal weapons, it doesn't refill after completing a stage. Additionally, X receives 1 less point of damage from every attack.</h1>
              
              <h1>Arm Parts- X can charge to a fourth level. At the third and fourth levels, X can fire a Double Charge Shot using each buster, allowing two Charge Shots in quick or delayed succession. It also allows him to charge special weapons.</h1>
              <h1>Foot Parts-X can perform an air-dash technique. However, he cannot utilize both an air-dash and a dash jump in the same jump.</h1>

            <div>
              <h1>Head Parts-X gains a ground-penetrating Item Radar (アイテムレーダー) that shows a map of the stage when X beams in to one of the eight stages. Uncollected Life Ups, Sub Tanks, Ride Armors, and Light Capsules are highlighted. These are also indicated on the stage select screen, color-coded to show which ones have not been found yet.

              </h1>
              
              
              <h1>Body Parts-Damage is reduced by half. When X is struck by an enemy's attack, a blue Defense Shield (ディフェンスシールド) is generated and additional damage is reduced. The amount of damage reduced with the force field active is 25% (approx. 62.5% total damage reduction).</h1>
              
              <h1>Arm Parts-X can charge his X-Buster up to four charge levels. At the fourth, X can fire out a Cross Charge Shot (クロスチャージショット) by shooting from both arms in rapid succession. When the armor is fully assembled, X uses half the weapon energy for his Special Weapons. It can also make X climb ladders faster. With this armor part, X can also charge up his Special Weapons.</h1>
              <h1>Foot Parts-X can use the Variable Air Dash (ヴァリアブルエアダッシュ). While in the air, X can dash straight forward or straight upward.</h1>

              <h2>The Fourth Armor</h2>
            </header>
            <div>
              <h1>Head Parts-Allowing X to fire endless uncharged special weapons.

              </h1>
              
              
              <h1>Body Parts-Allows X to use the Nova Strike. It is a rushing, invincible, damage-inducing attack, with limited energy that is restored over time. Also, the damage X receives is halved, and taken damage is absorbed to replenish the Nova Strike's energy.</h1>
              
              <h1>Arm Parts-These upgrade X's arms, changing his standard charge shot, while allowing him to charge weapons.
                Stock Charge Shot - Allows X to charge up four charged shots at once. Four icons of shots will appear next to X's life gauge that are used to keep track of the number of X's stocked shots. Whenever X fires while an icon is visible, he will fire a charged shot. The equipped parts will have white arms and blue fists. The only drawback to this part is that the charged shots are smaller in size.
                Plasma Charge Shot - Upgrades X's charged shots to the Plasma Charge Shot. This shot is much larger and more powerful than the standard blast, and will leave up to three plasma balls generated and causes continuous damage. The equipped parts will have black arms and red fists. The main drawback to this part is that the plasma balls left behind will take priority in dealing damage, meaning that if X fires a charged shot and then use a semi charged shot or special weapon afterwards, the damage will be cancelled due to the plasma ball already dealing damage.</h1>
              <h1>Foot Parts- X can air-dash and hover by double-jumping. He can move while hovering, but the amount of time he will stay airborne is reduced.</h1>

              <h1>Head Parts- In Mega Man X4, uncharged weapon usage was reduced to zero. In X5 and X6, this increases the maximum Special Weapon shot capacity by 50%, just like the Fourth, Falcon, and Blade Armor Head Parts in their respective games.

              </h1>
              
              
              <h1>Body Parts-Reduces damage taken by X by 50%. Allows X to use a wider range Nova Strike that does not consume any weapon energy. It also covers more distance than its X4 counterpart. Note, however, that X needs to touch solid ground/cling to a wall before it can be used again.</h1>
              
              <h1>Arm Parts- Grants the powerful Plasma Charge Shot. In X4, the fully charged shot can pierce straight through enemies, shields, and walls, leaving behind a damaging residue. However, in X5 and X6, the shot will be stopped by shields or walls. The Plasma Charge Shot is also weaker like X5's Fourth Armor's.</h1>
              <h1>Foot Parts- Grants the ability to air dash or hover in midair. Midair hovering time is decreased if X moves.</h1>
